# Soccer API


## Description

* This project designed to create a soccer API, of all teams and players in the top 5 leagues of europe (and rossia, from some reason...).

* The data was scrapped from understat.com

* I used the web-scrapping method, using "puppeteer" on Node.js .

* The database contain over 3000 players and over 100 teams.

* This API is meant for progremming purposes only.
